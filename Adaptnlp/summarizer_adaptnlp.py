text = """Natural Language Processing (NLP) has advanced significantly since 2018, when ULMFiT and Googleâ€™s release of the BERT language model approached human-level performance on a range of use cases. Since then, several models with similarly interesting names such as XLM, GPT-2, XLNet, and ALBERT have been released in quick succession, each improving on its predecessors. While these state-of-the-art models can solve human-level, language-based tasks on large volumes of unstructured text for certain use cases, getting a handle on what to use, when to use it, and how to use it can be a challenge."""
